# AI Productivity Codebase Vectorization & RAG Blueprint

This blueprint outlines the comprehensive process to vectorize your code base using a small language model and utilize Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about your code.

---

## Overview

The aim is to transform your entire code base into a vectorized format. These vectors are then stored in a searchable index. When a query is received, it is vectorized using the same small language model, and the closest matches are retrieved. These retrieval results are then fed to the language model (RAG pipeline) to generate a context-aware answer.

## Process Outline

### 1. Code Collection and Preprocessing
- **Gather Source Files:**
  - Recursively scan your code repository to extract source code files.
- **Normalize and Clean:**
  - Comments might be useful for the context
  - Optionally, split files into logical chunks (functions, classes, blocks) to ensure more granular embeddings.
- **Chunking Strategy:**
  - Determine an optimal size for each code chunk (considering token limits).
  - Maintain context between code segments where applicable.

---

### 2. Vectorization with small language model
- **Choose a small language model:**
  - Use models capable of generating embeddings for code (e.g., OpenAIâ€™s code embeddings or similar).
  - Use an SLM with less than 3B parameters to create robust embeddings.
- **Embed Each Code Chunk:**
  - Process every chunk through the small language model to obtain vector representations.
- **Store Vectors in an Index:**
  - Utilize a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, or any custom solution) to index and store the vectors.

---

### 3. Query and Retrieval Pipeline (RAG)
- **Query Embedding:**
  - Convert user queries into vectors using the same small language model.
- **Similarity Search:**
  - Perform a nearest neighbor search in the vector database to retrieve the most similar code chunks.
- **Contextual Prompting:**
  - Pass retrieved code chunks along with the query to the language model.
  - The model synthesizes this combined context to produce a comprehensive answer.

## Implementation Strategy

### Step-by-Step Blueprint:
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Install necessary dependencies for code parsing, vectorization (e.g., transformers, FAISS), and the small language model.
   - Configure access to any external APIs if required by the small language model.

2. **Data Extraction Module:**
   - Write a script to traverse the file system, read files, and preprocess content.
   - Implement chunking logic based on function boundaries or fixed token sizes.

3. **Embedding Pipeline:**
   - Create a module that interfaces with the small language model.
   - Ensure reproducibility in the vectorization process.
   - Integrate error handling and logging.

4. **Vector Indexing:**
   - Set up the vector database.
   - Create routines to add vectors to this database along with metadata (file path, code snippet, etc.).

5. **RAG Integration:**
   - Develop the query module to embed user queries.
   - Retrieve the top-N similar code chunks.
   - Construct a dynamic prompt combining the query and retrieved context.
   - Query the small language model for an answer or further elaboration.

6. **User Interface / API:**
   - Create a command line interface (CLI) or API endpoint to submit queries.
   - Display the augmented results along with references to the most relevant code sections.

7. **Testing & Iteration:**
   - Validate the quality of the embeddings.
   - Iterate on the chunking size and search parameters for optimal results.
   - Incorporate user feedback to refine the retrieval and answer generation process.

## Operational Considerations

- **Scalability:**
  - Plan for efficient vector storage and quick similarity search even for large codebases.
- **Consistency:**
  - Ensure the chunking and embedding processes are consistent across runs to avoid discrepancies in the index.
- **Security & Privacy:**
  - Handle sensitive code with appropriate security measures.
- **Maintenance:**
  - Implement automated routines to update the vector index as the code base evolves.

## Conclusion

By following this blueprint, you create a robust system that leverages small language model-based vectorization and retrieval augmented generation. This enhances productivity by enabling precise context retrieval and accurate query responses from your code base.

Happy coding!
